IMPORTANT!!!!!
Must use 3ds max 2015 or above.

Usage:

1. Go to MAXScript menu and run script file csv_reader_v341_v19_.ms

1.a If not set already, we must set root to "data" folder of Rome Total War 2. Set the root to the data folder by pressing button "Set Root Path...", locate the folder data and use it.

2. Load variantmesh definition by clicking "Load XML Definition..." button and locate the variantmeshes, typically here: Total_War_Rome2\data\variantmeshes\variantmeshdefinitions
Note, you can load the rigid meshed directly as well, it will contain skeleton as well if it should have any.
Warning, many of the variantdefinitions will not load as the script has bugs.
However, rigidmodels with or without skeletons seems to load just fine.

3. For Animation:
Load the list of animations by pressing the button "Load csv Anim List..." and locate the file. For example: Total_War_Rome2\data\animations\attila_animations.csv
The list will load and you can chose a proper animation from the list, either by double clicking, or selecting it and then pressing "Load Selected Animation" button in the bottom right.
